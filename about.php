                Kimo is a web system designed to help our users monitor their children in real time. Our special design
                provides easy user-experience so that it can be accesible to everybody, regardless of age and gender.
            </h5>

            <h5 align="left">
                We provide real time information about the location on the map of the child or group of children, alongside
                with a series of danger notifications in the event of them leaving a safe space set by the user. Also,
                notifications will be sent regarding possible collisions with objects (predefined, that present a certain
                amount of danger).
            </h5>

            <h5 align="left">
                Kimo also provides an interface of running the monitored kids, giving the possibility of finding out with
                whom they interact.
